Feedback for X (Lead Business Analyst) – H1 Review

This feedback is for the first half of the year (H1), based on my experience working with X, who is the Lead Business Analyst for our LoansHub program. I’ve been working with him for a long time, and during this period, especially in H1, his contributions have stood out.

What differentiates X from other BAs is his clear, point-to-point explanation of requirements, which has helped the development team deliver efficiently. He is also very good at creating mock views and presentations, making it easier to visualize the requirements before development starts.

A key differentiator is his strong grip on data and SQL queries—he has frequently supported the team by providing queries and insights, which has been critical in our development work.

During H1, X has played a crucial role in the successful delivery of major capabilities like the 360 app and RAE app in LoansHub. Along with his individual contributions, X has also demonstrated strong leadership by effectively distributing work within his team of BAs, guiding them well and ensuring smooth collaboration across teams. He is highly committed and takes ownership, often going the extra mile, including working extended hours when required to meet goals.

Overall, X brings a rare combination of clarity, data expertise, and leadership, making him a key contributor to the success of LoansHub deliveries in this period.

Feedback for Diep (Lead Developer) – H1 Review

This feedback is for the first half of the year (H1), based on my experience working with Diep on the LoanShub program. As a seasoned Java developer, Diep has played a key role in the successful delivery of major capabilities like the 360 app and RAE app, ensuring we met timelines and quality expectations.

Diep has been our go-to person for all Open CAT-related development, particularly on the Open CAT UI apps. His strong expertise in Open CAT has been instrumental in helping the LoanShub team deliver feature-rich, stable Open CAT applications.

In addition to his technical contributions, Diep has guided the team in adopting and effectively using GitHub Copilot, improving the team’s productivity and code quality.

Diep also brings valuable cross-functional knowledge, often sharing inputs on Python modules within the LoanShub ecosystem. His readiness to help beyond his immediate scope reflects his commitment to the overall success of the project.

As one of the two lead developers in the team, Diep and I have worked closely together, with Diep primarily supporting on the Open CAT UI side, while I have been focusing on the backend. He has consistently stretched himself to support the broader development team whenever needed, showing both technical leadership and team spirit.

Overall, Diep’s technical strength, cross-functional contributions, leadership, and collaborative approach have made him a key contributor to the success of LoanShub deliveries in this period.
