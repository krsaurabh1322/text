Feedback for X (Lead Business Analyst) – H1 Review

This feedback is for the first half of the year (H1), based on my experience working with X, who is the Lead Business Analyst for our LoansHub program. I’ve been working with him for a long time, and during this period, especially in H1, his contributions have stood out.

What differentiates X from other BAs is his clear, point-to-point explanation of requirements, which has helped the development team deliver efficiently. He is also very good at creating mock views and presentations, making it easier to visualize the requirements before development starts.

A key differentiator is his strong grip on data and SQL queries—he has frequently supported the team by providing queries and insights, which has been critical in our development work.

During H1, X has played a crucial role in the successful delivery of major capabilities like the 360 app and RAE app in LoansHub. Along with his individual contributions, X has also demonstrated strong leadership by effectively distributing work within his team of BAs, guiding them well and ensuring smooth collaboration across teams. He is highly committed and takes ownership, often going the extra mile, including working extended hours when required to meet goals.

Overall, X brings a rare combination of clarity, data expertise, and leadership, making him a key contributor to the success of LoansHub deliveries in this period.
