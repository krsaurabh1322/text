1. Risk, Control and Conduct Commentary

Sudhanshu consistently demonstrates sincerity and a responsible approach to his work. He proactively addresses defects and responds quickly to issues raised by users or QA, helping maintain stability of the RAE application. While MVP1 had delays and some functional gaps, he handled fixes in a timely manner and showed accountability throughout the delivery. As he continues to grow, strengthening his communication clarity will help him identify risks earlier and share potential impact proactively.

2. Valued Behaviour Commentary

Sudhanshu has been a key contributor to the RAE MVP1 and MVP2 UI development, supporting one of the major modules within the LoansHub program. He collaborates well with the team, is receptive to feedback, and is sincere in his efforts to improve. Although there were challenges in early deliveries, he has shown perseverance and ownership, and the product is now well received by users. He is actively working on improving communication and is making visible progress. Going forward, increasing his ability to contribute to solution design (rather than relying primarily on direction from others) will significantly enhance his overall impact.

3. Performance Commentary

As a senior developer, Sudhanshu has provided steady support throughout the year, particularly on the RAE UI implementation. He handled bugs and follow-ups efficiently and contributed to stabilizing the product after initial delivery hiccups. He collaborates positively with peers and remains approachable and dependable. To progress to the next level, he should continue maturing his technical decision-making—taking more ownership of design aspects and proactively shaping solutions rather than waiting for guidance. Strengthening communication will also help him articulate issues and influence outcomes more effectively.
