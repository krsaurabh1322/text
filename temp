✅ Valued Behaviour Commentary (Updated with your points)

Throughout the year, I demonstrated strong ownership, adaptability, and collaboration across multiple initiatives. I began by contributing to LH360 while also supporting the team on SQL-related improvements. I worked closely with developers to strengthen their understanding of database structures, review SQL changes, and guide them toward more efficient query design and better data-handling practices.

A key focus area for me was ensuring the development team had a clear understanding of the code they were writing—especially for OpenCAT and related components. I bridged knowledge gaps by providing direct knowledge-transfer sessions, clarifying functional flows, and arranging discussions with CAT SMEs whenever deeper insights were required. This helped promote a culture of learning and increased the team’s confidence and effectiveness.

I initiated and led design work for the CLO program, collaborating with stakeholders to shape a scalable solution. Although the program did not proceed due to budget constraints, I ensured that the design outputs remained well-documented and reusable. I then shifted to supporting the rebuild in the new technology stack, adapting quickly and contributing technically where needed.

I also played an active role in project planning, working closely with lead BAs and lead QAs to define a strategic roadmap for LoansHub for the year. This included effort estimation, sequencing of work items, and ensuring alignment between development capacity and business priorities.

Overall, I consistently upheld high engineering standards, encouraged knowledge sharing, strengthened team capability, and maintained transparent collaboration with cross-functional partners.

✅ Valued Behaviour Commentary (Shortened to 2 Points Each)

Do the Right Thing

Ensured high-quality delivery by guiding the team on SQL, Java, and OpenCAT code practices, and providing clear KT sessions or SME connections when needed.

Acted with integrity and ownership, making design and implementation decisions transparent, well-reasoned, and aligned with project goals.



---

Never Settle

Drove continuous improvement by developing utilities like MFU and rule engine components, and by helping the team adopt better, simpler technical approaches.

Adapted quickly to shifting priorities (e.g., CLO changes) and contributed to planning and reusable design work that supports long-term system evolution.



---

Better Together

Collaborated closely with developers, BAs, QAs, and SMEs to remove blockers, ensure clarity, and maintain smooth delivery across a large team.

Supported team capability growth through mentoring, PR reviews, and hands-on guidance, fostering a positive and productive environment.



---

If you'd like, I can also shrink it even further (one line per point) or rewrite in a more formal tone.




n line with our core values, I have focused this year on acting with integrity, improving continuously, and working collaboratively to support successful delivery.
