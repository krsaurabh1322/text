Got it 👍 If your manager asks you to show something quickly in a presentation, the slides should be clean, high-level, and structured to tell your story in 5–6 minutes. Since you want to cover your contributions, your team, and your areas of focus, here’s a suggested slide outline with draft content (you can make it in PowerPoint/Google Slides):


---

Slide 1 – Title / Intro

One-on-One Discussion – [Your Name]

Current Role: Development Lead (7-member team)

Focus: Delivery + Team Leadership + Technical Growth



---

Slide 2 – Key Contributions (2025)

LH360 – Contributed to development, well received by users.

MFU File Utility – Built to streamline data processing.

CLO Project – Leading for last 3 months, ensuring delivery.

Ongoing balance between team management and technical contributions.



---

Slide 3 – My Team

7 Developers – mix of junior and senior.

My role includes:

Code reviews & quality control

Doubt clarification & guidance

Driving meetings & delivery coordination


Seniors handle complex tasks; juniors improving steadily with mentoring.



---

Slide 4 – Areas I Oversee

Backend & Frontend development of applications

Integration patterns: Solace, FileIT

Database design & optimization

Python development for utilities & automation



---

Slide 5 – Personal Growth & New Areas

Balancing leadership responsibilities with hands-on coding

Started learning & applying AI concepts

Focus on improving architecture/design exposure

Building mentoring skills to grow the team’s capability



---

Slide 6 – Discussion Points for Today

Feedback on: Am I meeting expectations as a dev lead?

Guidance on balancing technical contribution vs. leadership focus

Opportunities for growth: Architecture, AI, team development



---

👉 Tips for Delivery:

Keep slides minimal text, more bullet points.

Use one slide per theme (don’t cram).

Talk through the story — don’t just read.

Do you want me to make this into a polished PowerPoint draft (with layout suggestions) that you can directly use and tweak?



That’s a very practical concern 👍 — deciding where to duplicate with a simulation table vs. where to scope inside existing tables.

Let’s walk through it systematically, based on your entities:


---

🔹 1. Principles for Deciding

High-churn, user-editable simulation entities → separate tables
(to isolate experimental data, avoid risk of mixing with production).

Mostly read-only / reference data → reuse main table with scoping
(don’t duplicate unless simulation can modify them).

Derived entities (reports, audit) → separate but linked to simulation
(since they’re outputs of a run, not inputs).



---

🔹 2. Table by Table

✅ Clo Hedge (master entity)

Separate simulation table is best (clo_hedge_sim).

Because this is where simulation diverges most (new hedges, modified hedges).

Promotion = move from clo_hedge_sim → clo_hedge_main.



---

✅ Clo Allocation

Allocations depend on hedges.

If hedges are simulated, allocations must also be simulated.

Keep a clo_allocation_sim table linked to clo_hedge_sim.hedge_id.

Promotion moves both together.



---

⚠️ Lookup Tables (programs, class mappings, etc.)

If programs are static (predefined) → use same lookup tables for main + simulation.

If users can create new programs/rules in simulation →

Create program_sim, program_mapping_sim.

Only simulate the new/modified entries, not the entire lookup.

Reads can be unioned: program_main ∪ program_sim.




---

✅ Rules

Rules are dynamic and part of the “what-if” scenario.

Create rules_sim table.

User can draft/edit rules in simulation.

Promotion = copy validated rules → rules_main.



---

✅ Reports

Reports are outputs of simulation runs, so they must be separate.

Create reports_sim table keyed by (simulation_id, version_no).

No promotion — instead, if simulation is promoted, you regenerate official reports in reports_main.



---

⚠️ Loan Inventory

If simulations can start at the loan level (i.e., tweak loan inventory itself), then yes, have loan_inventory_sim.

If simulation always starts after loan inventory, then no need.



---

🔹 3. Suggested Schema Layout

loan_inventory_main
loan_inventory_sim (optional, only if loan-level sims are needed)

clo_hedge_main
clo_hedge_sim

clo_allocation_main
clo_allocation_sim

program_main
program_sim (only if user creates/modifies programs)

program_mapping_main
program_mapping_sim (same rule as above)

rules_main
rules_sim

reports_main
reports_sim (always separate, never promoted)

lookup tables (static ones like countries) → no sim copy


---

🔹 4. Java App Design Implications

Simulation Context (simulation_id, version_no) → always passed down to service + DAO layer.

When in simulation mode →

CRUD hedges/allocations/rules → *_sim tables.

Reads from lookups → main tables (plus union with sim if applicable).

Reports → generated into reports_sim.


When promoted →

Data is copied from *_sim to *_main.

Reports are regenerated in reports_main (not copied).




---

🔹 5. Why Not Duplicate Everything?

Lookup tables can explode in size → no benefit in copying unless you allow edits.

Reports shouldn’t be copied → they are derived, not inputs.

Audit tables should stay global → they log both main + simulation actions.



---

✅ Summary Recommendation

Always duplicate hedges, allocations, rules (simulation tables).

Duplicate program/mapping tables only if simulation can create new ones.

Never duplicate static lookups (like country tables).

Keep reports_sim separate — don’t promote, just regenerate in main after approval.



---

Would you like me to sketch a data flow diagram that shows how simulation tables sit parallel to main tables, and which ones get promoted vs. regenerated?
