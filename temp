"We are currently facing a few challenges: 

1. **Development Speed**: The development process on Open Cat is not as fast as expected. Developers need to spend significant time preparing and configuring it, which slows down overall progress.  
2. **Feature Limitations**: Some features are restricted due to the limitations inherent in Open Cat, which impacts the flexibility needed for development.  
3. **Slow Release Cycle**: The release cycle for Open Cat is slower than desired, causing delays in deploying updates and new features.  

Addressing these issues could significantly improve development efficiency and delivery timelines."
