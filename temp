Team, here are the results from the in-office voting:
Based on the responses, it seems most people prefer coming in on Thursdays and Fridays. Everyone has agreed on Friday as the second in-office day. For the first day, it was a close call between Thursday and Monday, with Thursday receiving two more votes. So, the final in-office days will be Thursday and Friday.



The candidate appeared unprepared for the interview. He struggled with basic multithreading concepts and demonstrated weak understanding of data structures and database fundamentals. Overall, his responses lacked depth and clarity.

I would not recommend moving forward with this candidate.

As a general observation, we‚Äôve noticed a recurring pattern where candidates are not adequately prepared for interviews and often struggle with foundational technical questions.



Here‚Äôs a polished draft reply you could send back to Jerome‚Äôs email:

Subject: Re: CLO Resources

Hi Jerome,

Thanks for sharing this. Just to give you a quick update on the current resourcing status for CLO:

So far, CLO delivery has been running with only 1 developer actively contributing.

Wojciech is still in KT phase and hasn‚Äôt started coding yet.

Ravi joined in the last Sprint.

Jakub D and Jakub K are yet to contribute as they are still wrapping up other commitments.

As of now, the active delivery scope for CLO is limited to CLO Replenishment and Reporting. The Loan Ticketing tool has not yet been picked up.


Just wanted to clarify this so we‚Äôre aligned on the actual bandwidth and progress so far.

Regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make this slightly firmer (emphasizing the risk due to low active bandwidth) or keep it as a neutral status update?





Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a really thoughtful way to put it. Here‚Äôs a polished version you could enter in the form, combining your point with the mentoring/design strengths you mentioned earlier:


---

Comments:
‚ÄúWhen you are at your best, you are actively listening to the team and encouraging collaboration, which really helps us grow together. You create space for others to share ideas and contribute, and you bring people together to find solutions. Along with your mentoring and guidance, and your strong design expertise, this collaborative approach makes the team feel supported and more confident in delivering our goals.‚Äù

Do you want me to make it shorter and punchier (2‚Äì3 lines) so it‚Äôs quick to read, or keep it detailed and descriptive like above?



Got it üëç You want to keep it focused on collaboration and incentives. Here‚Äôs a polished way you could phrase it in the form:


---

Comments:
‚ÄúTo be an even better leader, you could encourage even more collaboration across the team and create opportunities where people feel motivated through recognition or incentives. This would not only strengthen teamwork but also help individuals feel more valued and driven to contribute their best.‚Äù

Would you like me to make this shorter and crisp (1‚Äì2 lines) or keep it slightly detailed like above?




Here‚Äôs a professional and positive draft you could use for Gautam‚Äôs feedback:

Feedback for Gautam:
‚ÄúI had the opportunity to work with Gautam during the LoanHub stress testing, and it was a very positive experience. He is good-natured, approachable, and always willing to listen and help. Gautam is technically sound and brings strong expertise to his role as Lead Load Test Engineer. His ability to collaborate and provide guidance makes it easy to work with him, and his support added real value to the testing effort.‚Äù

Do you want me to also add a suggestion for improvement (something small and constructive), or keep it as purely positive feedback?
