Team, here are the results from the in-office voting:
Based on the responses, it seems most people prefer coming in on Thursdays and Fridays. Everyone has agreed on Friday as the second in-office day. For the first day, it was a close call between Thursday and Monday, with Thursday receiving two more votes. So, the final in-office days will be Thursday and Friday.



The candidate appeared unprepared for the interview. He struggled with basic multithreading concepts and demonstrated weak understanding of data structures and database fundamentals. Overall, his responses lacked depth and clarity.

I would not recommend moving forward with this candidate.

As a general observation, weâ€™ve noticed a recurring pattern where candidates are not adequately prepared for interviews and often struggle with foundational technical questions.
