Path rootPath = Paths.get(rootDir).toRealPath().normalize();
Path filePath = rootPath.resolve(sanitizedFilename).normalize();

}

return filePath;



Team, here are the results from the in-office voting:
Based on the responses, it seems most people prefer coming in on Thursdays and Fridays. Everyone has agreed on Friday as the second in-office day. For the first day, it was a close call between Thursday and Monday, with Thursday receiving two more votes. So, the final in-office days will be Thursday and Friday.



The candidate appeared unprepared for the interview. He struggled with basic multithreading concepts and demonstrated weak understanding of data structures and database fundamentals. Overall, his responses lacked depth and clarity.

I would not recommend moving forward with this candidate.

As a general observation, we‚Äôve noticed a recurring pattern where candidates are not adequately prepared for interviews and often struggle with foundational technical questions.



Here‚Äôs a polished draft reply you could send back to Jerome‚Äôs email:

Subject: Re: CLO Resources

Hi Jerome,

Thanks for sharing this. Just to give you a quick update on the current resourcing status for CLO:

So far, CLO delivery has been running with only 1 developer actively contributing.

Wojciech is still in KT phase and hasn‚Äôt started coding yet.

Ravi joined in the last Sprint.

Jakub D and Jakub K are yet to contribute as they are still wrapping up other commitments.

As of now, the active delivery scope for CLO is limited to CLO Replenishment and Reporting. The Loan Ticketing tool has not yet been picked up.


Just wanted to clarify this so we‚Äôre aligned on the actual bandwidth and progress so far.

Regards,
[Your Name]


---

Would you like me to make this slightly firmer (emphasizing the risk due to low active bandwidth) or keep it as a neutral status update?





Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a really thoughtful way to put it. Here‚Äôs a polished version you could enter in the form, combining your point with the mentoring/design strengths you mentioned earlier:


---

Comments:
‚ÄúWhen you are at your best, you are actively listening to the team and encouraging collaboration, which really helps us grow together. You create space for others to share ideas and contribute, and you bring people together to find solutions. Along with your mentoring and guidance, and your strong design expertise, this collaborative approach makes the team feel supported and more confident in delivering our goals.‚Äù


---

Do you want me to make it shorter and punchier (2‚Äì3 lines) so it‚Äôs quick to read, or keep it detailed and descriptive like above?



Got it üëç You want to keep it focused on collaboration and incentives. Here‚Äôs a polished way you could phrase it in the form:


---

Comments:
‚ÄúTo be an even better leader, you could encourage even more collaboration across the team and create opportunities where people feel motivated through recognition or incentives. This would not only strengthen teamwork but also help individuals feel more valued and driven to contribute their best.‚Äù


---

Would you like me to make this shorter and crisp (1‚Äì2 lines) or keep it slightly detailed like above?




Here‚Äôs a professional and positive draft you could use for Gautam‚Äôs feedback:


---

Feedback for Gautam:
‚ÄúI had the opportunity to work with Gautam during the LoanHub stress testing, and it was a very positive experience. He is good-natured, approachable, and always willing to listen and help. Gautam is technically sound and brings strong expertise to his role as Lead Load Test Engineer. His ability to collaborate and provide guidance makes it easy to work with him, and his support added real value to the testing effort.‚Äù


---

Do you want me to also add a suggestion for improvement (something small and constructive), or keep it as purely positive feedback?



Got it üëç thanks for clarifying. Since Kajal is moving from Band 8 ‚Üí Band 7 (entry ‚Üí independent contributor), the promotion write-up should highlight:

Improved independence & reduced need for supervision

Consistency and reliability in delivery

Material improvement vs. last year

Readiness to handle tasks at Band 7 level (but not overstating leadership/ownership)


Here‚Äôs a toned-down, balanced draft you can use:


---

1. Platform

Kajal has shown material improvement in her work this year compared to last year. She has transitioned from needing close supervision to being able to handle her tasks independently with minimal handholding. The scope of her work has expanded to include more complex assignments such as data ingestion, automation utilities, and UI enhancements, which are at the level expected of a Band 7.


---

2. Promotion Justification

Technical Delivery: Successfully implemented ingestion flows using Solace Queue and Postgres, automated SQL execution utilities, and contributed to product UI enhancements. These contributions reduced manual effort and improved efficiency for teams.

Consistency: Delivered multiple assignments (e.g., Investor Call Report Service, self-service permission enablement) with good quality and within timelines.

Improvement vs. Last Year: Demonstrated stronger problem-solving skills, more reliable execution, and the ability to complete end-to-end tasks without constant guidance.

Band 7 Readiness: While not yet leading modules or people, she is consistently performing at the level of an independent contributor expected at Band 7.



---

3. Development (New Role/Level)

At the new level, Kajal should continue to strengthen her technical depth and work towards:

Taking end-to-end ownership of modules over time.

Building confidence in design and solution discussions.

Developing the ability to mentor peers on tools and automation she has implemented.



---

This keeps it realistic: acknowledges her growth, highlights independence (the key differentiator between Band 8 & 7), but does not exaggerate leadership/ownership.

üëâ Do you want me to also prepare a shorter version (3‚Äì4 bullet style sentences under each heading) in case the form has tight word limits?


Perfect, here‚Äôs a concise version with one paragraph each for Promotion Justification and Development:


---

Promotion Justification
Kajal has demonstrated clear improvement over the past year, moving from requiring close supervision to independently handling tasks of higher complexity. She has delivered solutions in data ingestion, automation, and UI enhancements with consistency and good quality, reducing manual effort and improving team efficiency. While she is not yet leading modules, her ability to execute end-to-end assignments with minimal guidance reflects readiness for the expectations of Band 7.

Development (New Role/Level)
At the next level, Kajal should continue to build on her technical strengths by taking on more end-to-end ownership of modules and contributing actively to design discussions. Over time, she should also focus on developing confidence to guide peers in areas where she has built expertise, laying the foundation for broader responsibility and leadership in future roles.


---

Would you like me to also draft the Platform section in a similarly concise paragraph, so the whole submission has a uniform style?


Thanks for sharing Ravi‚Äôs details. Since he‚Äôs moving from Band 7 ‚Üí Band 6 (junior developer ‚Üí senior developer), the focus should be on:

Handling complex technical solutions independently

Consistency and reliability in delivery

Wider impact of his contributions

Not overstating leadership/ownership, but showing senior-level readiness


Here‚Äôs a structured draft for him, aligned with the three sections:


---

1. Platform

Ravi has grown steadily in his role this year, taking on technically complex assignments and delivering them with quality and consistency. His work has expanded from executing individual tasks to implementing solutions that improve workflows, system reliability, and performance. This reflects readiness for the broader scope and higher responsibility expected of a Band 6.


---

2. Promotion Justification

Ravi has successfully delivered several impactful initiatives, including the migration of UWR applications to PostgreSQL, design and optimization of the Credit Insurance Workflow, and critical fixes in the UWR module that enhanced user experience and reduced manual effort. He has also built new features such as the Program Summary Page using the OpenCat framework and enhanced system capabilities like deal pop-ups and automated workflows. In addition, Ravi has upskilled himself in AI/ML and Python, applying this knowledge to strengthen development practices. These contributions demonstrate his ability to handle complex solutions independently, making him well suited for the expectations of a senior developer at Band 6.


---

3. Development (New Role/Level)

At Band 6, Ravi should continue to strengthen his technical depth by taking ownership of modules end-to-end and contributing more actively to system design discussions. Building on his experience with performance improvements and workflow automation, he can expand his impact by mentoring junior colleagues and proposing design optimizations that align with team strategy. Over time, this will prepare him for broader responsibilities and eventual readiness for Band 5.


---

Would you like me to also make a shorter, compact version (like 4‚Äì5 sentences total) in case the promotion form has strict word limits?




You‚Äôre absolutely right üëç ‚Äî the Development section should highlight what the candidate is expected to do at the new band immediately after promotion, not something that looks the same for both.

Since:

Kajal is going Band 8 ‚Üí Band 7 (entry ‚Üí independent contributor) ‚Üí focus on independence, handling tasks without supervision, and improving reliability.

Ravi is going Band 7 ‚Üí Band 6 (junior ‚Üí senior developer) ‚Üí focus on taking ownership of modules, complex solutions, mentoring juniors, and contributing to design.


Here‚Äôs a refined version that makes the distinction clear:


---

‚úÖ Kajal ‚Äì Development (Band 7)

At Band 7, Kajal should focus on further strengthening her ability to work independently by handling end-to-end tasks with minimal guidance. She is expected to improve her problem-solving skills, deliver consistently reliable solutions, and gradually take on slightly larger, more complex assignments that prepare her for future ownership.


---

‚úÖ Ravi ‚Äì Development (Band 6)

At Band 6, Ravi is expected to step up from being an independent developer to taking ownership of complete modules or workflows. He should actively contribute to design discussions, ensure scalability and performance in his solutions, and begin mentoring junior colleagues in areas where he has developed expertise. This will allow him to demonstrate senior developer competency and lay the groundwork for future leadership roles.


---

üëâ This way, their Development sections don‚Äôt look copy-paste, but instead reflect the specific expectations of their next band.

Do you want me to also reframe their Platform sections in the same style, so it‚Äôs clearer what ‚ÄúBand 7 vs Band 6‚Äù readiness looks like?




Thanks for sharing Rajeshwar‚Äôs inputs. Since he is also moving Band 7 ‚Üí Band 6 (junior ‚Üí senior developer), we should highlight:

His independence and ability to deliver complex work

His support to teammates and being a point of contact (early signs of leadership)

His breadth of contributions across multiple systems (Credit Insurance, Strategy Tracker, LoansHub360, CMS, migrations)

Position him as ready for senior developer responsibilities


Here‚Äôs a draft across the three sections:


---

1. Platform

Rajeshwar has grown in scope and responsibility this year, taking on complex tasks across multiple applications such as Credit Insurance, Strategy Tracker, LoansHub360, and CMS migrations. He has consistently delivered within deadlines while ensuring quality outcomes. Beyond his own tasks, he has also supported teammates by troubleshooting technical blockers and serving as a reliable point of contact for several applications, demonstrating maturity and readiness for the wider responsibility expected of a Band 6.


---

2. Promotion Justification

Rajeshwar has made strong technical contributions by successfully delivering the commercial go-live of the Credit Insurance App, migrating Strategy Tracker from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, and developing APIs/UI for the LoansHub360 application within tight deadlines while also learning the new OpenCAT framework. He contributed to decommissioning efforts (CMS from BPSI), supported the equity-risk migration, and actively resolved issues raised by teams. Importantly, Rajeshwar has also shown leadership traits by assisting colleagues in overcoming technical blockers and acting as a dependable point of contact across applications. His combination of technical competence, consistency, and collaborative approach reflects readiness for the responsibilities of a senior developer at Band 6.


---

3. Development (New Role/Level)

At Band 6, Rajeshwar should continue to build on his strengths by taking full ownership of specific modules or systems and contributing more actively to design and architecture discussions. Given his collaborative approach, he is also expected to mentor junior colleagues and provide technical guidance where required. Strengthening his solution design capabilities and broadening his exposure to end-to-end delivery will help him establish himself firmly as a senior developer and prepare for future leadership opportunities.


---

üëâ Do you also want me to recast Ravi and Rajeshwar side-by-side so that their development paths don‚Äôt sound repetitive, but instead highlight Ravi as technical depth + module ownership and Rajeshwar as technical depth + early leadership traits?
