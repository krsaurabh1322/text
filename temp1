You want to propose additional support (frontend, backend, tester) plus structured training — but in a professional, strategic way that shows collaboration, not dependency.
Here’s how you can position it clearly and confidently.
🔹 How to Frame the Proposal Strategically
Instead of saying “we need help”, position it as:
Ensuring smooth migration
Accelerating adoption of the new stack
Reducing rework and defects
Building long-term internal capability
The key message:
Temporary embedded support + structured deep-dive training = faster, higher-quality transition.
🔹 Structure Your Proposal Around 3 Pillars
1️⃣ Temporary Embedded Support (Short-Term)
Propose:
1 Frontend developer (for integration guidance)
1 Backend developer (for architecture & runtime guidance)
1 QA/Test engineer (for validation approach in new stack)
Clarify:
Duration: 2–4 weeks (or one sprint cycle)
Goal: Knowledge transfer + real-time mentoring
Outcome: Your team becomes self-sufficient
2️⃣ Structured Deep-Dive Sessions
Suggest formal sessions covering:
Frontend
Project structure
State management
API integration patterns
Error handling standards
Build & deployment pipeline
Backend
Architecture overview
Service layering
Auth & security handling
Environment configuration
Logging & monitoring
How to run locally & debug
Deployment process
QA
Test strategy in new stack
Automation tools
API testing patterns
CI integration
3️⃣ Defined Outcomes
Propose measurable outcomes like:
Team can independently run frontend & backend locally
Team can add new feature end-to-end
Team understands deployment flow
Reduced dependency after sprint 1 or 2

Subject: Proposal for Structured Knowledge Transfer & Embedded Support During Stack Migration
Hi [Name],
As we continue the migration to the new stack and progress on the generic backend development, we would like to ensure that the transition is both efficient and sustainable for the long term.
While we have initiated development, we believe a short period of structured guidance would significantly accelerate our understanding of:
Frontend integration patterns
Backend architecture and runtime setup
Deployment and environment configuration
Testing approach in the new stack
To ensure smooth adoption and minimize rework, we would like to propose the following:
1 Frontend developer to collaborate with our team for one sprint (integration & architecture guidance)
1 Backend developer to guide best practices, runtime setup, and architectural decisions
1 QA/Test engineer to help establish testing standards in the new stack
This would not only help us understand the intricacies of the stack more deeply but also ensure that we become fully self-sufficient moving forward.
Additionally, we suggest conducting structured deep-dive sessions covering frontend architecture, backend service design, environment setup, CI/CD process, and testing strategy.
We believe this short-term collaboration will significantly improve delivery speed, reduce defects, and strengthen long-term ownership within our team.
Please let us know your thoughts — we are happy to align on scope and duration.
Best regards,
[Your Name]
🔹 If You Want a More Assertive Version
If timelines are tight and risk is high, you can say:
Given the complexity of the migration, embedded support during the initial sprint is critical to ensure architectural alignment and avoid costly refactoring later.
🔹 Why This Approach Works
It sounds strategic, not needy
It emphasizes risk mitigation
It focuses on long-term ownership
It frames it as temporary and structured
It shows you’re already working, not waiting
If you’d like, I can also:
Create a shorter executive-summary version
Create a more formal enterprise version
Or tailor it based on whether this is internal, vendor-facing, or client-facing
Who is this proposal going to — internal leadership, vendor, or client?
