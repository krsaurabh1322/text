Here’s a proposed database schema and system architecture based on your requirements.


---

Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

Loan Inventory Table

Stores all loans available in the system.

CREATE TABLE loan_inventory (
    loan_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('available', 'allocated', 'replenished', 'closed')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Program Table

Stores CLO programs.

CREATE TABLE program (
    program_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Loan-Program Mapping

Tracks which loans are allocated to which programs.

CREATE TABLE loan_program_mapping (
    mapping_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INT REFERENCES program(program_id),
    loan_id INT REFERENCES loan_inventory(loan_id),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Rules Table

Stores eligibility criteria and replenishment conditions in JSON format.

CREATE TABLE rules (
    rule_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INT REFERENCES program(program_id),
    rule_type TEXT CHECK (rule_type IN ('eligibility', 'replenishment')),
    rule_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Audit Table

Tracks all actions performed on loans, programs, and rules.

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type TEXT CHECK (entity_type IN ('loan', 'program', 'rule')),
    entity_id INT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    performed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    performed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

System Architecture

Backend (Java + Spring Boot)

Controllers: REST endpoints for CRUD operations on loans, programs, and rules.

Services: Business logic for applying rules and managing inventory.

Custom Rule Engine (MVEL or Java-based JSON parsing): Evaluates loan eligibility and replenishment logic dynamically.


Frontend (React)

Dashboard to manage loans, programs, and rule configurations.

Loan allocation and eligibility visualization.

Audit log viewing.


Database (PostgreSQL)

Stores structured data for loans, programs, rules, and logs.

Indexing for performance optimization.


Workflow

1. User creates a CLO program.


2. User uploads eligibility and replenishment rules (in JSON).


3. Loan inventory is checked against eligibility rules.


4. Loans are assigned to programs based on the rule engine.


5. Audit logs capture all activities.


6. Replenishment rules run periodically to adjust loan allocations.


_----±+++++++++


This looks like a structured loan management system with a rule-based engine for eligibility and replenishment checks. Since you're already considering Drools for business rule management, it should fit well for defining eligibility criteria and replenishment conditions dynamically.

Here’s a suggested high-level approach:

1. Program Management Module

Create, update, and manage CLO programs.

Assign rule sets (eligibility & replenishment conditions) to programs.



2. Loan Inventory Management

Maintain a repository of loans.

Support filtering, searching, and categorizing loans.



3. Loan Processing Engine

Match loans to programs based on eligibility criteria.

Allocate loans following replenishment rules.

Handle overrides if necessary.



4. Rule Engine (Drools or Alternative)

Store and execute eligibility & replenishment rules dynamically.

Provide audit trails and rule execution logs.



5. Workflow & Review Process

Facilitate approvals and legal reviews where necessary.

Implement optimization checks for loan selection.



6. Reporting & Analytics

Track loan allocations, replenishments, and rule evaluations.

Provide insights on program effectiveness

Designing a Generic Rule Engine

A generic rule engine should:

1. Support different rule types (e.g., eligibility, replenishment, discount rules).


2. Work with various domains (e.g., loans, customers, transactions).


3. Allow dynamic rule definition using SQL or other formats (e.g., MVEL, JSON).


4. Provide a modular architecture that integrates easily with any system.

1. Key Components of the Generic Rule Engine


---

2. Rule Engine Design - Key Classes

(1) Rule Service (Stores and Retrieves Rules)

@Service
public class RuleService {
    @Autowired private RuleRepository ruleRepository;

    public void saveRule(RuleEntity rule) {
        ruleRepository.save(rule);
    }

    public RuleEntity getRule(Long ruleId) {
        return ruleRepository.findById(ruleId).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Rule not found"));
    }

    public String getRuleQuery(Long entityType, String ruleType) {
        return ruleRepository.findByEntityTypeAndRuleType(entityType, ruleType).getRuleQuery();
    }
}

(2) Rule Repository (Database Layer)

@Repository
public interface RuleRepository extends JpaRepository<RuleEntity, Long> {
    RuleEntity findByEntityTypeAndRuleType(String entityType, String ruleType);
}

(3) Rule Entity (Database Table)

@Entity
@Table(name = "rules")
public class RuleEntity {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String entityType; // e.g., LOAN, CUSTOMER, ORDER
    private String ruleType; // e.g., ELIGIBILITY, REPLENISHMENT
    private String ruleQuery; // SQL or MVEL expression

    // Getters and Setters
}


---

3. Generic Rule Engine Implementation

@Service
public class RuleEngine {
    @Autowired private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
    @Autowired private RuleService ruleService;

    public boolean evaluateRule(Long entityId, String entityType, String ruleType) {
        String ruleQuery = ruleService.getRuleQuery(entityType, ruleType);
        String entitySpecificQuery = ruleQuery + " AND id = ?";
        
        List<Long> result = jdbcTemplate.queryForList(entitySpecificQuery, Long.class, entityId);
        return !result.isEmpty(); // True if entity matches rule
    }

    public List<Long> evaluateRuleForAll(String entityType, String ruleType) {
        String ruleQuery = ruleService.getRuleQuery(entityType, ruleType);
        return jdbcTemplate.queryForList(ruleQuery, Long.class);
    }
}


---

4. Controller APIs for Rule Evaluation

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/rules")
public class RuleController {
    @Autowired private RuleEngine ruleEngine;

    @GetMapping("/evaluate/{entityType}/{ruleType}/{entityId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Boolean> evaluateSingle(
            @PathVariable String entityType, 
            @PathVariable String ruleType, 
            @PathVariable Long entityId) {
        boolean result = ruleEngine.evaluateRule(entityId, entityType, ruleType);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }

    @GetMapping("/evaluate/{entityType}/{ruleType}")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Long>> evaluateBatch(
            @PathVariable String entityType, 
            @PathVariable String ruleType) {
        List<Long> result = ruleEngine.evaluateRuleForAll(entityType, ruleType);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }
}

5. Example Usage

(A) Loan Eligibility Rule

(B) Customer Discount Rule

6. Flow Diagram

I'll create a detailed flow diagram showing:

Rule Service (Stores rules)

Rule Engine (Executes rules)

Rule Repository (Database layer)

API interactions


Let me generate it now.




db.ExtinguishedUnderwritingView.find({ daysHeldAsAtToday: { $exists: true } }).forEach(function(doc) {
  var val = parseInt(doc.daysHeldAsAtToday);
  if (!isNaN(val)) {
    db.ExtinguishedUnderwritingView.updateOne(
      { _id: doc._id },
      { $set: { daysHeldAsAtToday: val } }
    );
  }
});


result = new java.util.ArrayList();
foreach (l : loanInventory) {
  if (l.ctryOfRisk == "JAPAN" || l.ctryOfRisk == "SINGAPORE") {
    entry = new java.util.HashMap();
    entry.put("loanId", l.loanId);
    entry.put("ctryOfRisk", l.ctryOfRisk);
    result.add(entry);
  }
}
return result;

You're on the right track by keeping logic on the backend and letting the UI just call APIs to get the data.

Here’s how to extend your current backend-API-React setup to support partial hedging, dynamic allocation, and contextual loan visibility across views without moving logic into the UI.


---

🔧 Backend Design (Java + PostgreSQL)

1. Extend Loan Inventory Table

You already have a limit field (say, in millions). Add:

hedged_amount     NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
available_for_hedging AS (limit - hedged_amount)

You can make available_for_hedging a generated column or compute it dynamically in SQL queries. This way, you always know what’s left.


---

2. Create a Hedging Allocation Table

This tracks all hedging allocations per view/strategy/etc.

hedging_allocations (
    id                UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_id           UUID REFERENCES loans(id),
    allocated_amount  NUMERIC,
    allocated_for     TEXT, -- e.g. 'View1', 'View2'
    created_at        TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at        TIMESTAMP
)

Whenever a user hedges or unhedges, insert/update/delete from this table.


---

3. Create an API that Returns Loans by View

This is the key part. Create an API endpoint like:

GET /api/loans/available?view=View2

The backend logic:

Joins loans with hedging_allocations

Groups by loan_id

Sums allocations

Filters:

Show loan if it still has limit > total_hedged (i.e., something available)

Exclude loan if for a previous view (e.g., View1), it's fully hedged



Example SQL:

SELECT l.*,
       l.limit - COALESCE(SUM(ha.allocated_amount), 0) AS available_amount
FROM loans l
LEFT JOIN hedging_allocations ha ON l.id = ha.loan_id
GROUP BY l.id
HAVING 
    SUM(CASE WHEN ha.allocated_for = 'View1' THEN ha.allocated_amount ELSE 0 END) < l.limit
    AND SUM(ha.allocated_amount) < l.limit

You can adjust this logic based on hierarchy of views (View1, View2, etc.).


---

4. POST / UPDATE Hedging Allocation via API

Your API should expose:

POST /api/hedging → to create/update allocation

DELETE /api/hedging/:id → to remove allocation (undo)

These APIs will:

Validate that total doesn’t exceed loan limit

Update hedging_allocations

Recalculate hedged_amount on loans if you're maintaining that as a column




---

🧠 Business Logic - Hedge Visibility by View

You need a view priority system. For example:

List<String> viewPriority = List.of("View1", "View2", "View3");

In backend:

For View2, show loans where:

Loan is not fully allocated in View1

Some available amount still remains after View1’s allocation


For View3, exclude any loans fully hedged in View1 + View2.



---

🖥️ React UI

Since UI doesn't do business logic:

1. Call /api/loans/available?view=View2


2. Render available_amount and allow hedging (partial/full) via form


3. Submit to /api/hedging to save


4. Refresh list after submit



Optional: show how much is already hedged.


---

🧪 Example Flow

Loan A has limit = 100

User in View1 hedges 60 → 40 remains

View2 gets available_amount = 40

User in View2 hedges 40 → now total is 100

View3 gets no result for Loan A

If View2 user reduces their hedge to 30 → 10 is now free

View3 again sees available_amount = 10 for Loan A



---

✅ Summary

Use a central allocation table.

API returns loans by computing effective available amount.

Maintain view hierarchy and apply logic per view.

Let UI stay simple: display, input, call API.
