Here’s a proposed database schema and system architecture based on your requirements.


---

Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

Loan Inventory Table

Stores all loans available in the system.

CREATE TABLE loan_inventory (
    loan_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    loan_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('available', 'allocated', 'replenished', 'closed')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Program Table

Stores CLO programs.

CREATE TABLE program (
    program_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Loan-Program Mapping

Tracks which loans are allocated to which programs.

CREATE TABLE loan_program_mapping (
    mapping_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INT REFERENCES program(program_id),
    loan_id INT REFERENCES loan_inventory(loan_id),
    status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Rules Table

Stores eligibility criteria and replenishment conditions in JSON format.

CREATE TABLE rules (
    rule_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INT REFERENCES program(program_id),
    rule_type TEXT CHECK (rule_type IN ('eligibility', 'replenishment')),
    rule_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

Audit Table

Tracks all actions performed on loans, programs, and rules.

CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type TEXT CHECK (entity_type IN ('loan', 'program', 'rule')),
    entity_id INT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    performed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    performed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

System Architecture

Backend (Java + Spring Boot)

Controllers: REST endpoints for CRUD operations on loans, programs, and rules.

Services: Business logic for applying rules and managing inventory.

Custom Rule Engine (MVEL or Java-based JSON parsing): Evaluates loan eligibility and replenishment logic dynamically.


Frontend (React)

Dashboard to manage loans, programs, and rule configurations.

Loan allocation and eligibility visualization.

Audit log viewing.


Database (PostgreSQL)

Stores structured data for loans, programs, rules, and logs.

Indexing for performance optimization.


Workflow

1. User creates a CLO program.


2. User uploads eligibility and replenishment rules (in JSON).


3. Loan inventory is checked against eligibility rules.


4. Loans are assigned to programs based on the rule engine.


5. Audit logs capture all activities.


6. Replenishment rules run periodically to adjust loan allocations.


_----±+++++++++


This looks like a structured loan management system with a rule-based engine for eligibility and replenishment checks. Since you're already considering Drools for business rule management, it should fit well for defining eligibility criteria and replenishment conditions dynamically.

Here’s a suggested high-level approach:

1. Program Management Module

Create, update, and manage CLO programs.

Assign rule sets (eligibility & replenishment conditions) to programs.



2. Loan Inventory Management

Maintain a repository of loans.

Support filtering, searching, and categorizing loans.



3. Loan Processing Engine

Match loans to programs based on eligibility criteria.

Allocate loans following replenishment rules.

Handle overrides if necessary.



4. Rule Engine (Drools or Alternative)

Store and execute eligibility & replenishment rules dynamically.

Provide audit trails and rule execution logs.



5. Workflow & Review Process

Facilitate approvals and legal reviews where necessary.

Implement optimization checks for loan selection.



6. Reporting & Analytics

Track loan allocations, replenishments, and rule evaluations.

Provide insights on program effectiveness

Designing a Generic Rule Engine

A generic rule engine should:

1. Support different rule types (e.g., eligibility, replenishment, discount rules).


2. Work with various domains (e.g., loans, customers, transactions).


3. Allow dynamic rule definition using SQL or other formats (e.g., MVEL, JSON).


4. Provide a modular architecture that integrates easily with any system.

1. Key Components of the Generic Rule Engine


---

2. Rule Engine Design - Key Classes

(1) Rule Service (Stores and Retrieves Rules)

@Service
public class RuleService {
    @Autowired private RuleRepository ruleRepository;

    public void saveRule(RuleEntity rule) {
        ruleRepository.save(rule);
    }

    public RuleEntity getRule(Long ruleId) {
        return ruleRepository.findById(ruleId).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Rule not found"));
    }

    public String getRuleQuery(Long entityType, String ruleType) {
        return ruleRepository.findByEntityTypeAndRuleType(entityType, ruleType).getRuleQuery();
    }
}

(2) Rule Repository (Database Layer)

@Repository
public interface RuleRepository extends JpaRepository<RuleEntity, Long> {
    RuleEntity findByEntityTypeAndRuleType(String entityType, String ruleType);
}

(3) Rule Entity (Database Table)

@Entity
@Table(name = "rules")
public class RuleEntity {
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String entityType; // e.g., LOAN, CUSTOMER, ORDER
    private String ruleType; // e.g., ELIGIBILITY, REPLENISHMENT
    private String ruleQuery; // SQL or MVEL expression

    // Getters and Setters
}

3. Generic Rule Engine Implementation

@Service
public class RuleEngine {
    @Autowired private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
    @Autowired private RuleService ruleService;

    public boolean evaluateRule(Long entityId, String entityType, String ruleType) {
        String ruleQuery = ruleService.getRuleQuery(entityType, ruleType);
        String entitySpecificQuery = ruleQuery + " AND id = ?";
        
        List<Long> result = jdbcTemplate.queryForList(entitySpecificQuery, Long.class, entityId);
        return !result.isEmpty(); // True if entity matches rule
    }

    public List<Long> evaluateRuleForAll(String entityType, String ruleType) {
        String ruleQuery = ruleService.getRuleQuery(entityType, ruleType);
        return jdbcTemplate.queryForList(ruleQuery, Long.class);
    }
}


---

4. Controller APIs for Rule Evaluation

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/rules")
public class RuleController {
    @Autowired private RuleEngine ruleEngine;

    @GetMapping("/evaluate/{entityType}/{ruleType}/{entityId}")
    public ResponseEntity<Boolean> evaluateSingle(
            @PathVariable String entityType, 
            @PathVariable String ruleType, 
            @PathVariable Long entityId) {
        boolean result = ruleEngine.evaluateRule(entityId, entityType, ruleType);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }

    @GetMapping("/evaluate/{entityType}/{ruleType}")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Long>> evaluateBatch(
            @PathVariable String entityType, 
            @PathVariable String ruleType) {
        List<Long> result = ruleEngine.evaluateRuleForAll(entityType, ruleType);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }
}

(A) Loan Eligibility Rule

(B) Customer Discount Rule

6. Flow Diagram

I'll create a detailed flow diagram showing:

Rule Service (Stores rules)

Rule Engine (Executes rules)

Rule Repository (Database layer)

API interactions


Let me generate it now.




db.ExtinguishedUnderwritingView.find({ daysHeldAsAtToday: { $exists: true } }).forEach(function(doc) {
  var val = parseInt(doc.daysHeldAsAtToday);
  if (!isNaN(val)) {
    db.ExtinguishedUnderwritingView.updateOne(
      { _id: doc._id },
      { $set: { daysHeldAsAtToday: val } }
    );
  }
});


result = new java.util.ArrayList();
foreach (l : loanInventory) {
  if (l.ctryOfRisk == "JAPAN" || l.ctryOfRisk == "SINGAPORE") {
    entry = new java.util.HashMap();
    entry.put("loanId", l.loanId);
    entry.put("ctryOfRisk", l.ctryOfRisk);
    result.add(entry);
  }
}
return result;
